CodingTraining
==============

This repository holds coding challenges, solutions, and problem descriptions used to evaluate a person's coding ability.

Calculator
----------
This project is designed to be a contrived project that a senior developer "administers" to a trainee to give the trainee a base in programming.  It is a set of exercises that build on each other so that someone can get a good base in object oriented programming using TDD.

GUI Calculator
--------------
The GUI calculator is an exercise I've used before to teach new developers Visual Basic.  I've re-created it for myself for learning Javascript.  The write-up of the project is at http://myagilenotebook.blogspot.com/2014/08/calculator-exercise.html.  My first attempt at doing Javascript with it is under the gui_calculator folder.
